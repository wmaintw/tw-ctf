### Build docker image

Just run shell script `./build-docker-image.sh` to build the docker image. The name of the image is hardcoded, and it is `twctf-xss`, you can change it from source code.

### Run docker container

You can do so by running shell script `./run-docker-container.sh 8001`. The parameter `8001` is the port number, you can change it to any value you want.
